# Pomodoro Timer Project

This is a functioning Pomodoro timer with break timers and alerts. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros. After about four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 20 minutes. The Pomodoro Technique helps you resist all of those self-interruptions and re-train your brains to focus. Each pomodoro is dedicated to one task and each break is a chance to reset and bring your attention back to what you should be working on.

This was a fun project that I did for Thinkful. I remember reading through all the code that came with this project and feeling extremely overwhelmed. There were so many functions I didn't understand the purpose of, so I grabbed a notebook and wrote notes about each one until I felt confident enough to adapt it. Once I started, it was a fun challenge making the progress bar and timers.
