# pomodoro-timer-project

This is a Thinkful project that I made! It is a functioning Pomodoro timer with break timers and alerts.
Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros. After about four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 20 minutes.

This project is made with React, and is focusing on state management!
